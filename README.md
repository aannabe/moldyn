# Simulating Realistic Matter Behavior with Molecular Dynamics

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/aannabe-moldyn/badge/?version=latest)](https://aannabe-moldyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This repository demonstrates that realistic matter behavior can be obtained using simple effective models, such as [Lennard-Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential) potential:

$$
V_{\mathrm{LJ}} = 4 \epsilon \left[ \left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^{6} \right].
$$

For instance, the animation below shows how a fluid changes to a solid state as the temperature is decreased.
